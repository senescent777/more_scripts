1. about backup09:

Years ago i wrote a backup-script. In turn it utilized xfsdump for "heavy lifting". I think i made it run in cron under account "backupuser". 
The target was external usb-disk.

First version was from the year 2008.It seems that i have started to re-write it during 2009. Not yet sure if the new version works. 

Maybe i'll make that new script work again some day.



2. obviously beowulf-vlc has something to do with a) that remastering-thing i've been doing b) installing vlc into devuan beowulf livecd.
   
I think there were also alternate sources.list which included "debian multimedia project":s repository. 
Update:it seems that tlv1 or tlv2 have suffered a case of bitrot. So i'll have to figure out how exactly did i build those archives all those years ago.

4. misc contains some configuration files i found useful with debian-ish distributions
5. may have something to do with firefox profiles


Use this stuff at your own risk.
