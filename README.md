Years ago i wrote a backup-script. In turn it utilized xfsdump for "heavy lifting". I think i made it run in cron under account "backupuser". 
The target was external usb-disk.

First version was from the year 2008.It seems that i have started to re-write it during 2009. Not yet sure if the new version works. 

Maybe i'll make that new script work again some day.

Use it at your own risk.
